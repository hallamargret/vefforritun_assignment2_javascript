    <h1>Axios example</h1>
    <p>In this example, we perform a GET request to "https://veff-boards-h1.herokuapp.com/api/v1/boards", and a POST
        request to "https://veff-boards-h1.herokuapp.com/api/v1/boards/1/tasks".
        You are free to use/adapt these examples to your needs in Project 2.</p>
    <p>Note 1: Pay close attention to the differences in code: The GET request has no request body (there is no second
        parameter in axios.get()), and returns an array of elements. The POST request has a request body (an object
        containing all the required attributes), and returns a single object. Also, the POST request assumes that there
        is a board with id 0. This is something you maybe should not do in your actual application, but it's sufficient
        here for testing purposes.</p>
    <p>Note 2: The server-side applications are deployed to go into sleep if not used for a while. If you happen to send
        a request the first time in a while (and no other student has done so recently), it will take a while until you
        get a response.</p>
